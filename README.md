## Introduction, Stereophotogrammetry

The term stereophotogrammetry is composed of "stereo" and "photogrammetry."PHOTOGRAMMETRY" is the science of obtaining information reliable of physical objects and the environment through the reading and interpretation of photographic images. To identify the spatial position of a point through its its coordinates, it is necessary to observe the point from at least two distinct points of view, hence the prefix "STEREO." The acquisition and analysis of human motion is now employed in a variety of fields, from graphics and animation applications to sports and rehabilitation applications.  In particular, for biomechanical and clinical applications. The currently most common methods common involve a controlled laboratory environment and the use of markers applied to the patient's skin. In recent years, attention has turned toward systems noninvasive based on the acquisition of synchronized video sequences obtained with common cameras.

## System and calibration

For the tests conducted in the laboratory, we used 10 cameras set at 250 Hz (so such that we had 2500 frames in 10 seconds). The first procedure performed is the calibration and, therefore, the definition of the system of reference. This was chosen to have a right-handed triad with the Y axis oriented normal to the floor, the X axis oriented (inside the laboratory) parallel to the short side of the platform, which coincides with a surface of the sampling volume.

To do this, we used 3 carbon fiber rods with 9 markers arranged as following: 4 for the X axis, 3 for the Y axis, 2 for the Z axis.
